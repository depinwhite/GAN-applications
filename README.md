# GAN-applications
In this repository, I collect several simple notebooks in order to demonstrate the wide applicability of Generative Adversarial Networks for generating audio, texts and images.
### Images
[Notebook](https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/blob/main/Images/generating_human_faces.ipynb) shows how vanilla GAN handles human faces generation.
### Texts
[Notebook]([https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/tree/main/Texts](https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/blob/main/Texts/text-gan.ipynb) shows how vanilla GAN can be used for text generation. Examples of texts depending on the learning epoch are located in the [file](https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/blob/main/Texts/text_samples.txt). 
### Audio
[Notebook](https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/blob/main/Audio/SpecVQGAN_Demo.ipynb) shows how SpecVQGAN can generate sound from a video image. Notebook is taken from [here] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pxTIMweAKApJZ3ZFqyBee3HtMqFpnwQ0?usp=sharing), you can play around with it and upload your videos for dubbing. An example output of the model can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/depinwhite/GAN-applications/blob/main/Audio/example.wav).
